# Project Progression

UVM-based verification environment for the CFS Aligner DUT with APB register interface.

---

## Phase 1 — Environment Setup (Apr 2, 2026)

- Added DUT source files (`code/src/`): aligner core, edge detect, sync FIFO, RX/TX controllers
- Established the initial UVM environment skeleton: `cfs_algn_env`, `cfs_algn_pkg`, `cfs_algn_test_base`, `cfs_algn_test_pkg`
- Initial testbench top (`testbench.sv`)

## Phase 2 — APB Agent (Apr 3–23, 2026)

- Designed the APB agent structure: agent config, interface, item base/driver/monitor types
- Added APB item classes (`cfs_apb_item_base`, `cfs_apb_item_drv`)
- Implemented APB sequencer, driver, and sequence library (random, RW, simple)
- Completed the full APB agent with coverage and reset handler, reorganized under `code/test/cfs_apb_pkg/`
- Wired the APB agent into the environment; first register-access test (`cfs_algn_test_reg_access`)

## Phase 3 — MD Protocol Agent (Apr 29, 2026)

- Built the multi-data (MD) protocol agent from scratch: master/slave agent, driver, monitor, sequencer hierarchy
- Added MD item types (base, driver, monitor), coverage, and reset handler
- Implemented MD sequence library: simple master/slave, slave response (one-shot and forever)
- Integrated the MD agent into the environment alongside APB; added random test (`cfs_algn_test_random`)

## Phase 4 — UVM Extension Package (May 1, 2026)

- Introduced `uvm_ext_pkg` as a reusable base layer on top of UVM
- Added `uvm_ext_agent_config`: common agent configuration base class
- Added `uvm_ext_reset_handler`: standardized reset handling across agents
- Completed the full extension layer: `uvm_ext_monitor`, `uvm_ext_coverage`, `uvm_ext_sequencer`, `uvm_ext_driver`, `uvm_ext_agent` — all parameterized base classes

## Phase 5 — Agent Consolidation (May 1, 2026)

- Consolidated the APB agent into a single packed file (`packed_cfs_apb_pkg.sv`) integrating `uvm_ext_pkg`
- Consolidated the MD agent into a single packed file (`packed_cfs_md_pkg.sv`) integrating `uvm_ext_pkg`
- Archived the original unpacked component files under `code/test/archive/` for reference

## Phase 6 — UVM Register Model Integration (May 3, 2026)

- Renamed packed agent packages back to individual files by removing the "packed" prefix
- Built the supporting infrastructure for register access: env config, register predictor, APB adapter, and register configuration sequence
- Wired the register model into the environment alongside reset handling support
- Fixed several bugs in the register definitions (CTRL constraints, IRQ access type, IRQEN field name)
